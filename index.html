After thinking and thinking I decided to do it the best way i know how<br>
Through code.Lazma nikuwe extra .hehehehehe..<br>
There are so many things you have helped me through<br>
I cant name them all juu they are so many, all the way since 2018 you have been there for me through everything i've experienced<br>
I just wanted to say I appreciate everything you've done for me and i love you so so much<br>
There are so many things I would not have managed if you were not there for me<br>
As you turn 19,I wish you all the best<br>
Live life at your best,vunja mifupa kama meno ipo<br>
Follow your dreams girl<br>

  Yours truly,<br>
